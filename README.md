# QuoteMe
Simple Quote database app and Widget

QuoteME uses a prepopulated Room database to store quotes. A user may add or remove quotes at any time. 

The Widget allows for quotes to be displayed on the homescreen and is refreshed upon tapping the Quote text.

It is a simple, minimalistic app, yet utilizes some important basic components such as recyclerview, gesture detection, Room database and Widget handling.
